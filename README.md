# Chatsounds

Audio repo for [the chatsounds plugin](https://github.com/SpiralP/rust-classicube-chatsounds-plugin) for [ClassiCube](https://www.classicube.net/)~

## Adding sounds

Drag and drop sound files into [a folder](/sounds) to add them into the game easily!

It's better to categorize the sounds into folders. You can create a new folder by opening and editing [this url](/../../upload/master/sounds/folder_name).

Please make sure the files are [small and in a commonly used audio format](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt#L13) before uploading.

You can use the [Chatsounds Converter](https://chatsounds-converter.spiralp.xyz) to convert into small ogg files easily.

If you do not have access to this repo, you will have to click Fork at the top right and use your own personal repo to make a pull request. After committing, [open a new pull request](/../../pull/new/master).

More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Metastruct/garrysmod-chatsounds/blob/master/HOW%20TO%20ADD%20SOUNDS.txt) and [here](https://github.com/PAC3-Server/chatsounds/blob/master/README.md).
